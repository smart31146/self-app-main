  description: "The Beck Hopelessness Scale is a true-false test designed for adults age 17–80, to measure three major aspects of hopelessness: feelings about the future, loss of motivation, and expectations. It was developed by Dr. Aaron Beck, the psychiatrist considered the father of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)",
  prompt: "Please answer each question as true or false base on how you have been feeling in the past week.",

9-14 = moderate, which means they might not yet be in immediate danger, but they must be checked on frequently
15-20 = severe, so they need support ASAP
