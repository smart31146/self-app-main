  Maximum score: 30
  Possible Depression: 10 or greater
  Always look at item 10 (suicidal thoughts)

  The cutoff score is usually a 12, although a score of 10 or higher and an affirmative response on the question pertaining to suicidal thoughts can be indicative of postpartum depression. An affirmative response on the question of whether an individual has experienced thoughts of self-harm, no matter the severity, is enough to warrant further evaluation and possible intervention.
